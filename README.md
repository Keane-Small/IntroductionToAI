# IntroductionToAI
This course covers core AI concepts, including deep learning, machine learning, and neural networks. Youâ€™ll examine generative AI models, including large language models (LLMs) and their capabilities.


## Module 1

### Traditional AI Framework

In traditional AI, data is stored in a repository, which includes various forms of information like tables, images, and documents.
An analytics platform processes this data to build predictive models, which are then applied to specific applications to take action, such as preventing customer churn.

### Feedback Loop in Traditional AI

A feedback loop is essential for traditional AI, allowing the system to learn from past predictions and improve its models over time.
This process helps refine the AI's accuracy by learning from both successes and mistakes.

### Generative AI Framework

Generative AI starts with vast amounts of data from external sources, rather than just an organization's internal repository.
Large language models (LLMs) are utilized, which require prompting and tuning to adapt them to specific business needs, such as understanding customer behavior in a telco context.

### Feedback Loop in Generative AI

Similar to traditional AI, generative AI also incorporates a feedback loop, but it primarily focuses on refining the prompting and tuning process.
The architecture of generative AI is fundamentally different due to the scale of data and models, making it necessary to adopt new approaches for effective implementation.

### The main difference between traditional AI and generative AI lies in their architecture and data usage:

### Traditional AI:

Data Source: Relies on a specific repository of data from within an organization.
Process: Involves predictive analytics where models are built using historical data to make predictions and take actions.
Feedback Loop: Utilizes a feedback loop to learn from past predictions and improve model accuracy over time.

### Generative AI:

Data Source: Starts with vast amounts of external data, not limited to an organization's internal repository.
Process: Uses large language models (LLMs) that require prompting and tuning to adapt to specific use cases.
Feedback Loop: Focuses on refining the prompting and tuning process, allowing the model to learn and improve based on broader data inputs.
